### Python made easy !!!
Intro to python

This is will help all the new beginners who are intrested in python programming



Variable declaration and initalization

1.illustrated how we declare and assign variables.Also illustrated how we allow a user to input

the varaibles by him or herself.This is done in the programs :area.py, volume.py and gross_pay.py

2.python operators

  a) added arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/,//,%)


  b) added relational operators (>,<,==,!=,>=,<=)

3.python decision making

  c) some illustrations of the various decision making statements that are used.


The statements used are 

  i) if statements

  ii) if .....else statements
  
  iii)if ...elif statements

*addition of input validation to check whether the user has entered negative values or marks that are above 100%

*there is a simple python game that shows the use of python libraries

4.Python functinos 

*In the functions folder there are programs that show how functions in python are defined and how they are declared.

5.Python Classes and objects

*There's a well illustration of how to declare classes with methods and their objects in the folder named Python Classes

  **Classes are defined using the key word Class <class_name>:
  
  **The __init__ funtion follows and this is where one should pass the attributes you want to use. The function is always there by default even if one fails to define it. The purpose of this function is to help one to initialize the variables that they are going to use.
  
  **When initailizing the variables in the __init__ function , there must be the self keyword which is used to pass the parameters of the attributes that one initializes. This is done in the __init__function.
  
  **When defining the other methods, the self keyword is used to refer to the values that are to be initialized in the particular function, hence there is no need to 
  initialize the variables again.
  
  **When calling the function one should pass the arguments that they declare in the __init__ function.

  **The object name is normally any name the user decides to use then assign it to the class name followed by the attributes/ the variables that one initialized at the start of the program.
  

6.Inheritance 

  **The folder inheritance contains programs that are used to implement single inheritance, multiple inheritance  and hierachical inheritance(in the file payment.py). 


7. Added a program in the python operators that will allow a user to enter the name and the price of the product and then the values will be stored in a dictionary

8. Added a program in the folder files that will open the name of the file with a .txt extension, read the content in the file and then return the total number of words present. the .split() function will remove the white spaces that separate the words.
